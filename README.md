# Eorzea Collection Importer

* Add Custom Repository https://github.com/Rukongai/MyDalamudPlugins/blob/master/pluginmaster.json
* Install Eorzea Collection Importer
* Copy a link from Eorzea Collection to your clipboard
* Ingame, open addon with /ecimporter
* Click import and wait for your chatbox to tell you "Import string copied to clipboard"
* Open Glamourer and hit the Paste icon on a design that you want to import the equipment from

## Note
Hold down the CTRL key when hitting the Paste icon in Glamourer to only import equipment if you are applying to a design with character customizations, otherwise it will overwrite those.
Will only import one ring currently until I get smart enough to fix.
